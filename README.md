## svg animations
svgs are the most popular extension for vector images, unlike rastor images (jpg, png ...) vector images dont contain pixels but calculations of the shapes that make the final image

this makes them easier to scale without the quality loss and it usually makes them take smaller file size if you are working with simple shapes
